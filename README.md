# CarPricePredictionProject
CarPricePrediction project in Python
🌟 Excited to Share My Latest Project! 🚗💻

As a Machine Learning Intern at CodexCue, I had the incredible opportunity to work on an exciting project focused on predicting car prices based on various features like age, mileage, brand, and transmission type.

🔍 Project Highlights:

Engineered features such as car age, mileage per year, and brand extraction to improve model accuracy.
Explored multiple regression models including Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
Implemented data preprocessing techniques, including one-hot encoding and binary encoding, to prepare the data for modeling.
Achieved impressive results by evaluating model performance with metrics such as MAE, MSE, and R².
💡 Key Learning:
This project provided me with hands-on experience in feature engineering, model training, and performance evaluation, enhancing my skills in practical machine learning applications.

A big thanks to the team at CodexCue for the support and guidance throughout this project. I'm excited to continue exploring the world of machine learning and applying these skills to real-world problems.
